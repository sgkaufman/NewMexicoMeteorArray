Directory structure used by RMS GUI Linux box, where most everything is stored 
at user pi level, not at root:

pi
  .config
    autostart
     autostart shortcuts for things started at boot/login

  .ssh	(you can use a single key or separate keys per camera)
    authorized_keys
    id_rsa
    id_rsa.pub
    known_hosts
    if you want separate keys, be sure to edit .config for separate key names
     this will probably be required if migrating old station from RPi to Linux box,
     since GMN seems to look through all key pairs in .ssh for a given station's 
     previously registered public key at GMN. Alternatively, notify GMN that you
     want to group all stations under a single key. Here's an example of separate 
     key pairs, where the primary pair is also found under the generic id_rsa and 
     id_rsa.pub file names:
    us0001.pub
    us0001
    us0002.pub
    us0002

  source
    Stations
      US0001
       .config
       platepar_cmn2010.cal
       mask.bmp (if needed)
       Start_Capture_US0001.sh (runs StartCapture --config /home/pi/Stations/US0001/.config)
       Live_Stream_US0001.sh 
      US0002
       .config
       platepar_cmn2010.cal
       mask.bmp (if needed)
       US0002.sh (used to StartCapture --config /home/pi/Stations/US0002/.config)

Suggested wiring topology using PoE switch:

External network using cable modem, DSL or Fiber
|
 Router for local network
 |
  RMS GUI Linux box
  PoE switch
  |
   Cam 1
   Cam 2
   Cam 3

The main local network router is connected by cable to both the Linux box and 
the PoE switch. The wired connection on the Linux box provides connectivity to 
external network and to the cameras by way of the PoE switch. The Linux box can 
also be connected by WiRi to the local network, but it may be best to turn WiFi
off since we want camera traffic to run thruogh  cable connections.
