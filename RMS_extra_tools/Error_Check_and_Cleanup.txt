Error_Check_and_Cleanup.txt

Several files are needed to conduct and support error checking of RMS/GMN data
Error_Check_and_Cleanup.py and .sh

To use these files, you need to call Error_Check_and_Cleanup.py as an external script, or, if you are already using an external script, you need to add the call to Error_Check_and_Cleanup.sh at the end of your existing script, just before the code to reboot the station.

If you are adding an external script for the first time, edit your .config file so it reads

; External script
; An external script will be run after RMS finishes the processing for the night, it will be passed
 
; three arguments:
;   captured_night_dir, archived_night_dir, config - captured_night dir is the full path to the 
;   captured folder of the night, the second one is the archived, and config is an object holding 
;   the values in this config file.
; ---------------
; Enable running an external script at the end of every night of processing
external_script_run: true
; Run the external script after auto reprocess. "auto_reprocess" needs to be "true" for this to work.
auto_reprocess_external_script_run: true
; Full path to the external script
external_script_path: /home/pi/source/RMS_extra_tools/Error_Check_and_Cleanup.py
; Name of the function in the external script which will be called
external_function_name: rmsExternal


; Daily reboot
; ---------------
; Reboot the computer daily after the processing and upload is done
reboot_after_processing: false
; Name of the lock file which the external script should create to prevent rebooting until the 
;   script is done. The external script should remove this file if the reboot is to run after the 
;   script finishes. This file should be created in the config.data_dir directory (i.e. ~/RMS_data)
.
reboot_lock_file: .reboot_lock

Error checking is logged to the file ~/RMS_data/<StationID>_fits.counts.txt
The first line of the file should read:

Directory Name         # fits_files  # detections  Other Issues

First the CapturedFiles data directory is listed, next the number of fits files found in that directory, next the number of detections reported in the filename of the detected stack, and finally, any other isses that are found. Other issues include:
 - shortfall in number of fits files captured or message if there are no fits files
 - if the number of archived directories does not match the number of captured directories
 - if the photometry file is missing, which may indicate a bad platepar
 - if there is only one capture directory, which can indicate the storage drive is too full. In this case the total size of the data drive and amount of free space is reported 

The total capture duration is used to calculate a maximum number of fits files that should be collected through the course of the night. This is done by dividing the capture duration in seconds by the time it takes to capture 255 video frames in a single fits file at a frame rate of 25 frames per second, which is 10.2 seconds. 
 duration_seconds / (255 / 25 = 10.2)

Because of a small amount of overhead as the system starts and stops capture, this calculated total typically overestimates by 4 fits files, so that number is subtracted before comparing to the number of fits files in the capture directory.

If the total fits files recorded is less than the corrected total a message is written to ~/RMS_data/<StationID>_fits.counts.txt showing the shortfall in file count and number of minutes of data that were missed.

Other errors may be noted following the number of detected meteors.

At the end of the  Error_Check_and_Cleanup.sh you can have the script clean out older files so there is more room to keep CapturedFiles directories. Sometimes it is important to have an older CapturedFiles directory available to extract data for a bolide that was too bright to be detected as a meteor.
This cleanup can be enabled or disabled by setting the variable CleanUp (around line 18 in the script) to either 1 or 0.
