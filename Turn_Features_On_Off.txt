there can be NO SPACES between any symbols on the line! Use the examples as

	put # in front on line 225:

	line 285, change default=False to True

Other settings:
enable My_Uploads
	To enable uploads to user specified site, place a file called 
	"My_Uploads.sh", containing correct upload instructions in 
	~/source/NMMA
	also see note above about My_Uploads=1 in TimeLapse.sh

	Here are the contents ~/source/NMMA/My_Uploads.sh for US000G:
	#!/bin/bash
	cd "$HOME"/RMS_data/My_Uploads
	sftp -b ../myup.txt gnto@complex.org

	ftp batch file: "$HOME"/RMS_data/myup.txt:
