How to turn ES and TL features on and off, 
27-Mar, 2021 change line number for turning off uploads to NM_server ES 245  -> 247
		matching ES 25-Mar, 2021 (14564)

19-Mar, 2021 change line number for turning off uploads to NM_server ES 237  -> 245
		matching ES 12-Mar, 2021 (14383)

13-Mar, 2021 last major revision

time lapse
	do this by changing the value in TL line at 26
	TimeLapse=0

captured stack
	do this by changing the value in TL line at 27
	Cap_Stack=0

my uploads
	do this by changing the value in TL line at 28
	My_Uploads=0

uploads to NM server
	For both manual and RMS methods
	For ES (14564 bytes) put # in front of line 247
	- this will add one byte to file size, so now 14565 bytes

reboot at end of ES
	To disable reboot in ES, on line 129, change reboot=True to False:
	log_upload=True, log_script=False, reboot=False, \
	 This will change byte count to 14,384

Future changes:
Consider later mods to TimeLapse.sh to allow copying tar.bz2 to user specified 
site via Extra_Uploads, if so, note that Cap_Stack.jpg, TimeLapse.mp4 and 
fits_counts are not in the tar.bz2


Consider altering sending to NM_Server to sending to XX_Server
- change IP number

- change lines 156:163
    # Create the config object for New Mexico Meteor Array purposes
    nm_config = copy.copy(config)
    nm_config.stationID = 'meteorstations'
    nm_config.hostname = '10.8.0.61' # 69.195.111.36 for Bluehost
    nm_config.remote_dir = remote_dir
    nm_config.upload_queue_file = 'NM_FILES_TO_UPLOAD.inf'
    # nm_config.data_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'NM_data')
    # nm_config.log_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'NM_data/logs')

- other changes to ES may be needed?

- later ?, change all vars by removing nm_

Mods_for_0S.txt

I did a bit of sleuthing on several files and here are my preliminary findings:

Compare my master copy of ExternalScript.py to the one on 0S

This is from the one on 0S:
This is Version 0.3Ca of file ExternalScript.py. Dated 07/23/2020.
RJM 07/23/2020: commented out call to upload files to NM Array database
                and added 'Ca' to distinguish between NM and CA stations.

Then on line 213 (which is line 210 in master copy)
    # getFilesAndUpload(log, nm_config, main_data_dir)


Looks like changes will need to be made on lines 173 to 180?
    # Create the config object for New Mexico Meteor Array purposes
    nm_config = copy.copy(config)
    nm_config.stationID = 'meteorstations'
    nm_config.hostname = '10.8.0.61'
    nm_config.remote_dir = remote_dir
    nm_config.upload_queue_file = 'NM_FILES_TO_UPLOAD.inf'
    # nm_config.data_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'NM_data')
    # nm_config.log_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'NM_data/logs')

and possibly also change the name on file: "NM_FILES_TO_UPLOAD.inf"


TimeLapse.sh master copy is functionally the same as the one on 0S
(but contains the call to create a capture stack), but master has more
comments and a few minor coding differences.

Then master copy TimeLapse3.sh has newer additions, copying four files to
My_Uploads and some other improvements. This is the version I'm running
on the Buster RMS stations.

Master copies:
TimeLapse.sh	10/12/2020
TimeLapse2.sh	10/12/2020
TimeLapse3.sh	12/10/2020

ExternalScript.py		02/13/2020
