How to turn ExternalScript.py, TimeLapse.sh, and .config features on and off
05-Apr, 2022, byte count 4848

IMPORTANT!: When making any changes to TimeLapse.sh, or any other Bash script, 
there can be NO SPACES between any symbols on the line! Use the examples as 
they are written, so var=value as in TimeLapse=1

time lapse
	Turn off by changing the value in TimeLapse.sh at line 26:
	TimeLapse=0
	Turn on by changing the value in TimeLapse.sh at line 26:
	TimeLapse=1

captured stack
	Turn off by setting the value in TimeLapse.sh at line 27:
	Cap_Stack=0
	Turn on by setting the value in TimeLapse.sh at line 27:
	CapStack=1

my uploads
	Turn on by changing the value in TimeLapse.sh line at 28
	My_Uploads=1
	This will cause RMS_data/My_Uploads to be populated,
	and My_Uploads.sh will be executed.
	See note below about My_Uploads.sh.
	Turn off by changing the value in TimeLapse.sh at line 28:
	My_Uploads=0


uploads to NM server, controlled by ES (ExternalScript.py)
	For both manual and RMS methods
	For ES (13700 bytes) put # in front on line 227:
	# Upload files to the NM Server
	# getFilesAndUpload(log, nm_config, main_data_dir, log_file)
	this may increase ExternalScript.py size in bytes by 1

reboot at end of ES (ExternalScript.py)
	For ES v1.0: Enable the reboot behavior when ES is called manually,
	this may increase ExternalScript.py size in bytes by 1
	line 131: change reboot=True to False
	log_upload=True, log_script=True, reboot=False, \

shell script in ES (ExternalScript.py)
	For ES v1.0: Enable the shell script logging when ES is called manually,
	line 131: change log_script=False to True
	To enable the shell script logging when ES is called by RMS, 
	line 285, change default=False to True


enable My_Uploads
	To enable uploads to user specified site, place a copy of the 
	correct upload instructions in a file called "My_Uploads.sh"
	located in source/RMS
	also see note above about My_Uploads=1 in TL


turn off uploads to GMN
	in .config, change true to false (~line number 128, after [Upload]):
	; Flag for enabling/disabling upload to server
	upload_enabled: true 

change size of uploads to GMN
	in .config, change 1 to 2, 3, or 4 (~line number 154, after [Upload]):
	; Flag for upload options
	upload_mode: 1

Future changes to ES v1.0 ?

Consider altering sending to NM_Server to sending to XX_Server
- change IP number

- change lines 156:163
    # Create the config object for New Mexico Meteor Array purposes
    nm_config = copy.copy(config)
    nm_config.stationID = 'meteorstations'
    nm_config.hostname = '10.8.0.61' # 69.195.111.36 for Bluehost
    nm_config.remote_dir = remote_dir
    nm_config.upload_queue_file = 'NM_FILES_TO_UPLOAD.inf'
    # nm_config.data_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'NM_data')
    # nm_config.log_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'NM_data/logs')

- other changes to ES may be needed?

- later ?, change all vars by removing nm_

Consider later mods to TimeLapse.sh to allow copying tar.bz2 to user specified
site via My_Uploads, if so, note that Cap_Stack.jpg, TimeLapse.mp4 and
fits_counts are not in the tar.bz2

Mods_for_0S.txt (Bob Massey's)

I did a bit of sleuthing on several files and here are my preliminary findings:

Compare my master copy of ExternalScript.py to the one on 0S

This is from the one on 0S:
This is Version 0.3Ca of file ExternalScript.py. Dated 07/23/2020.
RJM 07/23/2020: commented out call to upload files to NM Array database
		and added 'Ca' to distinguish between NM and CA stations.

Then on line 213 (which is line 210 in master copy)
    # getFilesAndUpload(log, nm_config, main_data_dir)


Looks like changes will need to be made on lines 173 to 180?
    # Create the config object for New Mexico Meteor Array purposes
    nm_config = copy.copy(config)
    nm_config.stationID = 'meteorstations'
    nm_config.hostname = '10.8.0.61'
    nm_config.remote_dir = remote_dir
    nm_config.upload_queue_file = 'NM_FILES_TO_UPLOAD.inf'
    # nm_config.data_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'NM_data')
    # nm_config.log_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'NM_data/logs')

and possibly also change the name on file: "NM_FILES_TO_UPLOAD.inf"


TimeLapse.sh master copy is functionally the same as the one on 0S
(but contains the call to create a capture stack), but master has more
comments and a few minor coding differences.
