and .config features on and off 

IMPORTANT!: When making any changes to any Bash script, there can be NO SPACES 
between any symbols on the line! Use the examples as they are written, so 
var=value as in Cleanup=1

TimeLapse mp4 files are now made by RMS normal processing. You can disable 
them by using this setting near the end of your .config file

[Timelapse]

; Automatically generate a timelapse using all FF files at the end of the night
timelapse_generate_captured: false


my uploads
	Turn on by changing the value in ErrorCheck.sh line at 14
	My_Uploads=1
	This will cause RMS_data/My_Uploads to be populated,
	and My_Uploads.sh will be executed.
	See note below about My_Uploads.sh.
	Turn off by changing the value:
	My_Uploads=0

Settings found in ExternalScript.py v2, 22-May-2023, 12303 bytes
uploads to NM server, controlled by ES (ExternalScript.py)
	For both manual and RMS methods
	put # in front on line 210:
	# Upload files to the NM Server
	# getFilesAndUpload(log, nm_config, main_data_dir, log_file)
	this may increase ExternalScript.py size in bytes by 1

reboot at end of ES (ExternalScript.py)
	To enable the reboot behavior when ES is called manually,
	line 129: change reboot=True to False
	log_upload=True, log_script=True, reboot=False, \

shell script in ES (ExternalScript.py)
	To enable the shell script logging when ES is called manually,
	line 129: change log_script=False to True
	To enable the shell script logging when ES is called by RMS, 
	line 271, change default=False to True

Other settings:
enable My_Uploads
	To enable uploads to user specified site, place a file called 
	"My_Uploads.sh", containing correct upload instructions in 
	~/source/NMMA
	also see note above about My_Uploads=1 in TimeLapse.sh

	Here are the contents ~/source/NMMA/My_Uploads.sh for US000G:
	#!/bin/bash
	cd "$HOME"/RMS_data/My_Uploads
	sftp -b ../myup.txt gnto@complex.org

	ftp batch file: "$HOME"/RMS_data/myup.txt:
	cd public_html
	mput *
	exit

	upload_enabled: true 

change size of uploads to GMN
	in .config, change 1 to 2, 3, or 4 (~line number 167, after [Upload]):
