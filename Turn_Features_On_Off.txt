IMPORTANT!: When making any changes to TimeLapse.sh, there can be NO SPACES
between any symbols on the line! Use the examples as they are written, so
var=value as in TimeLapse=1

time lapse
        Turn off by changing the value in TimeLapse.sh at line 26:
	TimeLapse=0
	Turn on by changing the value in TimeLapse.sh at line 26:
	TimeLapse=1

captured stack
	Turn off by setting the value in TimeLapse.sh at line 27:
	Cap_Stack=0
	Turn on by setting the value in TimeLapse.sh at line 27:
	CapStack=1

my uploads
	Turn on by changing the value in TimeLapse.sh line at 28
	My_Uploads=1
	This will cause RMS_data/My_Uploads to be populated,
	and Extra_Uploads.sh will be executed.
	See note below about Extra_Uploads.sh.
	Turn off by changing the value in TimeLapse.sh at line 28:
	My_Uploads=0

uploads to NM server
	For both manual and RMS methods
	For ES (14564 bytes) put # in front of line 247
	- this will add one byte to file size, so now 14565 bytes

reboot at end of ES
	For ES v0.8: Enable the reboot behavior when ES is called manually,
	line 129: change reboot=True to False:
	log_upload=True, log_script=False, reboot=False, \
	 This will change byte count to 14,384
	For ES v0.9 this line number is 119

shell script in ES
	For ES v0.8: Enable the shell script logging when ES is called manually,
	line 129: change log_script=False to True
	To enable the shell script logging when ES is called by RMS, 
	line 297, change log_script=False to True
	For ES v0.9 these line numbers are 119 and 286

enable extra uploads
	To enable extra uploads to user specified site, place a copy of
	the correct upload instructions in a file called "Extra_Uploads.sh"
	located in source/RMS
	also see note above about My_Uploads=1 in TL
_______________

Future changes:ES v0.9: drops upload to NM_Server for *.cal, .config, platepar
	and CALSTARS.txt

Consider later mods to TimeLapse.sh to allow copying tar.bz2 to user specified
site via Extra_Uploads, if so, note that Cap_Stack.jpg, TimeLapse.mp4 and
fits_counts are not in the tar.bz2


Consider altering sending to NM_Server to sending to XX_Server
- change IP number

- change lines 156:163
    # Create the config object for New Mexico Meteor Array purposes
    nm_config = copy.copy(config)
    nm_config.stationID = 'meteorstations'
    nm_config.hostname = '10.8.0.61' # 69.195.111.36 for Bluehost
    nm_config.remote_dir = remote_dir
    nm_config.upload_queue_file = 'NM_FILES_TO_UPLOAD.inf'
    # nm_config.data_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'NM_data')
    # nm_config.log_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'NM_data/logs')

- other changes to ES may be needed?

- later ?, change all vars by removing nm_

Mods_for_0S.txt (Bob Massey's)

I did a bit of sleuthing on several files and here are my preliminary findings:

Compare my master copy of ExternalScript.py to the one on 0S

This is from the one on 0S:
This is Version 0.3Ca of file ExternalScript.py. Dated 07/23/2020.
RJM 07/23/2020: commented out call to upload files to NM Array database
                and added 'Ca' to distinguish between NM and CA stations.

Then on line 213 (which is line 210 in master copy)
    # getFilesAndUpload(log, nm_config, main_data_dir)


Looks like changes will need to be made on lines 173 to 180?
    # Create the config object for New Mexico Meteor Array purposes
    nm_config = copy.copy(config)
    nm_config.stationID = 'meteorstations'
    nm_config.hostname = '10.8.0.61'
    nm_config.remote_dir = remote_dir
    nm_config.upload_queue_file = 'NM_FILES_TO_UPLOAD.inf'
    # nm_config.data_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'NM_data')
    # nm_config.log_dir = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'NM_data/logs')

and possibly also change the name on file: "NM_FILES_TO_UPLOAD.inf"


TimeLapse.sh master copy is functionally the same as the one on 0S
(but contains the call to create a capture stack), but master has more
comments and a few minor coding differences.
